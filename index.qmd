This website is a space for working through Quinn and Keough's 2nd edition [textbook](https://qkstats.com/) on data analysis for biologists. The `Chapter notes` are intended for review and discussion in a seminar (Oceans 200). The `Examples` are reproduced and occasionally lightly modified from the [original worked examples](https://mjkeough.github.io/index.html).
