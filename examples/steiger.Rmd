Steiger et al. (2008) studied the Coolidge effect, the decline in males' interest in mating with the same female compared to novel females, using the burying beetle *Nicrophorus vespilloides*. Eighteen male beetles were presented with the same female beetle four times, and then a novel female on the fifth occasion. This was a repeated measures design as the same individual males were repeatedly presented with females. There was no evidence that physical exhaustion affected time to mating as a separate control group of males were presented with novel, unmated females five times in succession, and there was no change in time to mating. The within-subjects factor was the order of presented females, and while this could have been treated as a continuous covariate, we treated it as a fixed factor with five groups. The response variable recorded on each occasion was time to mating.

### Preliminaries

First, load the required packages (afex, car, lattice, lme4, lmerTest, nlme, VCA, ez, emmeans, Rmisc, MuMIn)

```{r include=FALSE, results='hide'}
source("../R/libraries.R")   #This is the common library
```

Import steiger data file (steiger.csv)

```{r}
steiger <- read.csv("../data/steiger.csv")
steiger
```

Set contrasts from afex. Make individual a factor Rearrange matingnumber order to override default alphabetical order

```{r results='hide'}
set_sum_contrasts()
steiger$individual <- factor(steiger$individual)
steiger$matingnumber <- factor(steiger$matingnumber, levels=c("first","second","third","fourth","fifth"))
```

Quick boxplot to look at variances for different mating numbers

```{r }
boxplot(time~matingnumber, data=steiger)
```

### Fit OLS model with default aov SS

```{r }
steiger.aov <- aov(time~matingnumber+individual, data=steiger)
```

Check residuals - some evidence for interaction

```{r }
plot(steiger.aov)
```

### Do interaction plot

```{r }
interaction.plot(steiger$matingnumber, steiger$individual, steiger$time)
```

The rank order of treatments consistent but the sizes of the differences vary greatly between individuals. Quickly try boxplot with log-transformed data to see if any improvement

```{r }
boxplot(log10(time)~matingnumber, data=steiger)
```

### Transform to logs due to variance heterogeneity and to minimise interaction

```{r }
steiger$ltime <- log10(steiger$time)
```

Recheck diagnostics - much better with less interaction

```{r }
boxplot(ltime~matingnumber, data=steiger)
interaction.plot(steiger$matingnumber, steiger$individual, steiger$ltime)
```

### Fit OLS model with default aov SS

```{r }
steiger.aov1 <- aov(ltime~matingnumber+individual, data=steiger)
```

check residuals - look OK

```{r }
plot(steiger.aov1)
```

### Examine results

Once we're happy with the model that we're fitting, we can look at the results.

```{r }
tidy(steiger.aov1)
emmeans(steiger.aov1, "matingnumber")
```

Get Greenhouse Geiser adjusted results

```{r }
ezsteiger1 <- ezANOVA(data=steiger, dv=ltime, wid=individual, within=matingnumber, type=3, detailed=TRUE)
print(ezsteiger1)
```

Use VCA package to get anova var comps (with CIs that can be -ve)

```{r }
steiger.vca <- anovaMM(ltime~matingnumber+(individual), steiger)
steiger.vca
VCAinference(steiger.vca, alpha=0.05, VarVC=TRUE, excludeNeg=FALSE, constrainCI=FALSE)
```

## Fit random intercept model using lme4 and REML

```{r }
steiger.lmer1 <- lmer(ltime~matingnumber + (1|individual), REML=TRUE, steiger)
summary(steiger.lmer1, ddf="Kenward-Roger")
anova(steiger.lmer1, type=3, ddf="Kenward-Roger")
emmeans(steiger.lmer1, ~matingnumber)
```

Note different CIs compared to OLS model fitting due to K-R adjustment

CI on variance components (remembering to square CIs from lmer which are in SD units)

```{r }
steiger.ci1 <- confint.merMod(steiger.lmer1, oldNames=FALSE)
steiger.vc1 <- (steiger.ci1)^2
print(steiger.vc1)
```

### Bar graph for time main effect

```{r }
steiger_sum <- summarySE(steiger, measurevar= 'ltime', groupvars= 'matingnumber')
ggplot(steiger_sum, aes(x=matingnumber, y=ltime))+
  geom_bar(stat="identity", position="dodge", fill="lightblue")+
  geom_errorbar(aes(ymin=ltime-se, ymax=ltime+se), width=0.3, color="darkblue")
```
