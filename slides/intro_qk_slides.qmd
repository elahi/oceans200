. . .

Programming challenge (should you choose to accept it):

> If you are going to use slides, create them in [Quarto](https://quarto.org/docs/presentations/) (.qmd) or [Rmarkdown](https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/revealjs.html) (.Rmd)

Totally optional. In any case, please share your ppt slides, R code, other relevant materials with the group in the [Gdrive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1723s12LW6__s98KIVJmLaks06S1bX73m?usp=sharing).

## Prerequisites

You have some familiarity with R computing and statistics.

. . .

Do you know what all this means?

```{r intro}
x <- c(2, 4, 3, 6)
y <- c(5, 12, 4, 10, 2)
t.test(x, y)
```

# Some core statistical concepts

## Statistics vs parameters

. . .

A **statistic** is

:   a numerical description of a sample

. . .

A **parameter** is

:   a numerical attribute of a population

. . .

Often, *statistics* are used to estimate *parameters*.

## The two heads of classical statistics

-   estimating parameters, with uncertainty *(confidence intervals)*

-   evaluating (in-)consistency with a particular situation *(*$p$-values)

. . .

-   What do these data tell us about the world?

-   How strongly do we believe it?

## Lurking, behind everything:

is *uncertainty,* thanks to:

. . .

-   actual differences of biological interest (*process* uncertainty)

. . .

-   uninteresting differences due to sampling variation and measurement error (*observation* uncertainty)

. . .

How do we understand uncertainty, concretely and quantitatively?

. . .

-   with *models*.

## Break

Stand up! Stretch! Get a drink, use the restroom.

Then, with a partner(s), go to a board and discuss the following:

-   What is hypothesis testing?

-   What is a *p*-value?

## Data story

Low et al (2016) examined the effects of two different anesthetics on aspects of the physiology of the mouse. Twelve mice were anesthetized with isoflurane and eleven mice were anesthetized with alpha chloralose and blood CO~2~ levels were recorded after 120 minutes. The H~0~ was that there was no difference between the anesthetics in the mean blood CO~2~ level. This is an independent comparison because individual mice were only given one of the two anesthetics.

## R

```{r packages}
library(tidyverse)
library(car)

theme_set(theme_bw(base_size = 16) + 
            theme(panel.grid.minor = element_blank(), 
                  strip.background = element_blank()))
```

## The data

Describe what is happening in these lines of code.

```{r}
low <- read.csv("data/lowco2.csv")
```

Â 

. . .

```{r}
names(low)
```

\

. . .

```{r}
dim(low)
```

\

. . .

```{r}
str(low)
```

## Visualize data

```{r}
low %>% 
  ggplot(aes(anesth, co2)) + 
  geom_point(alpha = 0.5, size = 5) + 
  labs(x = "Anesthetic", y = "CO2") + 
  theme_bw(base_size = 24)
```

## Summarizing data: point estimates and variability

```{r}
low %>%  
  group_by(anesth) %>% 
  summarise(n = n(), 
            mean = mean(co2),
            median = median(co2),
            sd = sd(co2), 
            variance = var(co2), 
            se = sd / sqrt(n)
            )
```

<!-- **Your turn**.\ -->

<!-- Add to the `summarise` function to calculate the 95% confidence interval for each treatment using `qt`. Interpret the CI. You should get the same answer as in the book. -->

## Confidence intervals

```{r}
low %>%  
  group_by(anesth) %>% 
  summarise(n = n(), 
            mean = mean(co2),
            sd = sd(co2), 
            se = sd / sqrt(n), 
            CI_upper = mean + se * qt(p = 0.975, df = n-1), 
            CI_lower = mean + se * qt(p = 0.025, df = n-1), 
            CI = se * qt(p = 0.975, df = n-1), 
            upper = mean + CI, 
            lower = mean - CI
            )
```

In a frequentist world, parameters are fixed (but unknowable). Interpret the CI in this context.

## Hypothesis testing

A. Construct a null hypothesis (H~O~)

B. Derive a test statistic from the data

C. Compare the obtained test statistic to one derived from values obtained under the H~O~.

## A $p$-value is

. . .

> the probability of seeing a result at least as surprising as what was observed in the data, if the null hypothesis is true.

. . .

Usually, this means

-   *a result* - numerical value of a statistic
-   *surprising* - big
-   *null hypothesis* - the model we use to calculate the $p$-value

which can all be defined to suit the situation.

## What does a small $p$-value mean?

. . .

*If* the null hypothesis *was* true, then you'd be really unlikely to see something like what you actually *did*.

\

. . .

So, either the "null hypothesis" is not a good description of reality or something surprising happened.

\

. . .

How useful this is depends on the null hypothesis.

## T-test: equal variances

```{r}
t.test(co2 ~ anesth, var.equal = TRUE, data = low)
```

\

**Interpret this result.**

## Your turn

With a partner, go to the [website](https://elahi.github.io/qk2e/), check out the [source code](https://github.com/elahi/qk2e), and work though the [Chapter 2 notes](https://elahi.github.io/qk2e/chapter_notes/chapter2.html) together.

<!-- ## Test variances -->

<!-- ```{r} -->

<!-- leveneTest(co2 ~ anesth, low) -->

<!-- ``` -->

<!-- ## T-test: separate variances -->

<!-- ```{r} -->

<!-- t.test(co2 ~ anesth, data = low) -->

<!-- ``` -->

<!-- ## ANOVA -->

<!-- ```{r} -->

<!-- low.aov <- aov(co2~anesth,data=low) -->

<!-- summary(low.aov) -->

<!-- ``` -->

<!-- ## Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney -->

<!-- ```{r} -->

<!-- wilcox.test(co2~anesth,data=low) -->

<!-- sum(rank(low$co2)[low$anesth=="ac"]) -->

<!-- sum(rank(low$co2)[low$anesth=="iso"]) -->

<!-- ``` -->
